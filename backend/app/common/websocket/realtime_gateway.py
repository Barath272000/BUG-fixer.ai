"""
Mirrors: backend/src/common/websocket/{realtime.gateway,events}.ts

Publishes pipeline events to a per-project Redis channel. The Celery worker
(a separate process from the FastAPI web server) calls `publish()`; the
`/realtime` websocket endpoint (see app/modules/realtime/router.py, running
in the FastAPI process) subscribes to the same channel and relays messages
to connected browser clients. Redis is the bridge between the two processes.
